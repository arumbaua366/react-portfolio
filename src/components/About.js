        <p>
          I'm a Developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a recent
          graduate of the UC Davis Full-Stack Web Development program. Although
          my 9+ years of professional experience is in finance and human
          resources, those industries introduced me to my love for code. I'm a
          passionate problem solver and aim to create technology that can help
          solve the smallest problems. I also love musicals, cooking, travel
          gear ðŸ§³ (as well as traveling), and sci-fi movies/shows.
