              I am a recent graduate of the UC Davis Full-Stack Web Development program. Although my 8+ years of professional experience is in finance and human resources, those industries introduced me to my love for code. I'm a passionate problem solver and aim to create technology that can help solve the smallest problems. I also love
              musicals, cooking, travel gear ðŸ§³ (as well as traveling), and sci-fi movies/shows.
